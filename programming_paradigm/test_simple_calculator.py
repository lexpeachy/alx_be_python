# Import the Necessary Modules:

# Import the unittest module and the SimpleCalculator class from simple_calculator.py.
# Define a Test Class:

# Create a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
# Write Test Methods:

# Write at least one test method for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) provided by the SimpleCalculator.
# Include tests for edge cases, such as dividing by zero.
# Use Assertions to Verify Results:

# Utilize self.assertEqual() to check for expected outcomes.
# For the divide method, ensure you test both normal operation and division by zero.
# Running Your Tests:

# Run your tests using the command line: python -m unittest test_simple_calculator.py.
